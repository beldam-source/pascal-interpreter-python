# pascal-interpreter-python

An interpreter for a large subset of the Pascal programming language, implemented in Python.
Based on Ruslan Spivak's [blog posts](http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) on the subject. The series is currently incomplete, so until parts 7 and above are available, or until I learn Pascal and read a book on interpreters, this will remain just a calculator.

I also hope to implement a version of it in Java.
