# pascal-interpreter-python

A simple interpreter implemented in Python.
Based on Ruslan Spivak's [blog posts](http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) on the subject. The overall goal of the series is to build an interpreter for a large subset of the Pascal programming language, but the series is currently incomplete. The repo will be updated as new parts become available. Until then, it's a nice calculator, which I may extend by adding other math functions eventually.
